# MazeSlover
A maze solver with visual representation in Java that generates a random maze and solves it using BFS.<br />
It also shows the shortest path from the start node to the finish node.

When you will run the program a random maze will become visible. After that, you can press I for information about the controls of the program:<br />
Controls:<br />
R->Removes the coloring from the maze.<br />
G->Generates a new random maze and displays it.<br />
IMPORTANT! You can run the controls below only if you choose the start and finish point first! You can't choose the start or finish point to be a wall(black node).<br />
B->Runs a bfs alghorithm and paints purple the nodes which you can reach from the start node.<br />
S->Finds the sorthest path from the start to the finish node and paints it yellow.<br />
<br />

Further inprovements:<<br />
  Visualization of the BFS alghortihm steps.<br />
  Adding a DFS alghorithm and visualization of the DFS alghortihm steps.<br />
  Developing a game based on that idea.<br />
